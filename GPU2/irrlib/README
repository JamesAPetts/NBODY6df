Keigo made a new GPU function 9 Feb 2012: gpuirr.sse.cpp.get_list
Its use is as follows:
Replace gpuirr.sse.cpp;
In intgrt.omp.f, define INTEGER KTMP(LMAX)
At desired place: CALL GPUIRR_GET+LIST(I,KTMP)
The GPU neighbour list for #I is then given by KTMP.
This was used in a bug hunt which did not yield anything.
